## Alexander Koehler, Feng-Jen Hsieh, Yuandi Tang

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and results of the research paper **"MIMIC-CXR: Chest X-ray Image Classification and Report Generation"**. The project leverages the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which includes chest X-ray images along with corresponding radiology reports. The goal is to develop an automated system capable of both **classifying chest abnormalities** and **generating radiologist-style reports**. We utilize advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, alongside cutting-edge multimodal models, such as **LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct**, for text generation.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Classify Chest X-ray Abnormalities**: Train CNN models to detect common chest conditions, such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax.
2. **Generate Diagnostic Reports**: Use advanced language models to generate concise and accurate diagnostic reports based on the chest X-ray images.
3. **Multimodal Image-Text Alignment**: Employ multimodal models like **Vision 11B** and **LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct** to improve the alignment between visual features and textual descriptions.
4. **Enhance Healthcare Efficiency**: Improve diagnostic workflows and automate the process of chest X-ray interpretation.

## Key Contributions

- **CNN Architectures**: The paper employs popular CNN architectures such as **ResNet18**, **ResNet50**, and **VGG16** for image classification tasks. These models were fine-tuned on the MIMIC-CXR dataset to detect chest abnormalities.
  
- **Text Generation**: We use **LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct** for generating concise, clinically relevant radiology reports from the images, mimicking the workflow of expert radiologists.

- **Multimodal Alignment**: Integration of **Vision 11B** and **Onslaught** for vision-language alignment helps bridge image and textual data for accurate report generation.

- **Optimized Performance**: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection were conducted to achieve the optimal balance between accuracy, F1-score, and computational efficiency.

## Introduction

Chest X-rays are essential for diagnosing many chest conditions. However, manual interpretation of chest X-rays is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. The **MIMIC-CXR dataset**, comprising over 370,000 chest X-ray images paired with radiology reports, offers an opportunity to develop automated tools that assist radiologists by streamlining the image interpretation process.

This project explores how we can utilize state-of-the-art models for both image classification and text generation to automate chest X-ray interpretation. By combining image processing and natural language processing, we aim to enhance diagnostic workflows and reduce the workload of healthcare professionals.

## Dataset

The MIMIC-CXR dataset is publicly available and contains over 370,000 chest X-ray images along with full-text radiology reports. The dataset includes:

- **Chest X-ray images** in DICOM format.
- **Radiology reports** associated with each image.
- **Disease labels**: Binary disease annotations (e.g., pneumonia: 0 or 1).
- **View positions**: PA (posterior-anterior), AP (anterior-posterior), LATERAL.

We used a curated subset of 85,872 unique study IDs with images from various angles and associated disease annotations. This data was preprocessed and cleaned to fit the model training process.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline involved:

1. **Merging Metadata**: Data was merged from multiple CSV files containing patient records, CheXpert labels, and view positions.
2. **Text Extraction**: Full-text reports were extracted from ZIP archives and preprocessed for text generation tasks.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Images were resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized for input into CNN models. Data augmentation techniques, including random rotations and flips, were applied to improve model generalization.

### Model Architecture

#### CNN Models for Image Classification
The following CNN models were trained and evaluated for image classification:

- **ResNet18**: A lightweight, deep residual network known for efficient performance.
- **ResNet50**: A deeper residual network that showed superior accuracy.
- **VGG16**: A classic CNN architecture used as a baseline for comparison.

#### Text Generation
- **LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct**: This advanced language model was fine-tuned to generate diagnostic summaries from chest X-ray images.

#### Vision-Language Alignment
- **Vision 11B**: Used for aligning image features with textual descriptions to improve multimodal understanding.
- **Onslaught**: A Vision Transformer model optimized for medical image feature extraction.

### Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used to evaluate the balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Used to evaluate the performance of binary classification tasks.

### Installation

To run the code and replicate the results, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuanditang/MIMIC-CXR.git
cd MIMIC-CXR
```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download the MIMIC-CXR dataset by following the instructions on the official website.**
4. **Download pre-trained models or fine-tune them using the dataset.**

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the experiments with the following commands:
1.	**Train a model:**

python train.py --model resnet50 --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

2. **Evaluate a model:**

python evaluate.py --model resnet50 --test_data test_data.csv

3. **Generate reports:**

python generate_reports.py --model llama --input_images test_images/

## Results

Our experimental results indicate that the **ResNet50** model achieved the highest accuracy (92.3%) and F1-score (0.89) for pneumonia detection. **VGG16** showed competitive performance (88.7%) but with longer training times. The **LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct** model demonstrated excellent text generation performance with 95% concordance with human-generated reports.

### Performance Summary:

	•	**ResNet50:** Highest accuracy and F1 score.
	•	**VGG16:** Competitive, but slower.
	•	**ResNet18:** Best computational efficiency with slightly lower accuracy.

### Report Generation:

	•	**LLaMA-3.2** generated clinically relevant, concise reports with high accuracy in summarizing key findings.

## Conclusion

This project showcases an integrated approach for automating chest X-ray interpretation. By combining state-of-the-art image classification models with advanced natural language generation techniques, we significantly reduce the workload of radiologists and improve diagnostic accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to include other imaging modalities, enhancing the model’s adaptability, and integrating it into clinical settings for real-time analysis.
